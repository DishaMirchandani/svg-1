###Drawing on the Web Assignment 4

###Forked Deborah Lubanga's svg assignment of a timeline- by Disha Mirchandani 

I changed up the timeline by reducing the space between each carver and the two that were stencils instead of a silhouette larger and more rectangular to play around with the aesthetics. I loved her choice of gradient color so I kept that in my forked version of her project of the three carvers worked on the Stone Mountain Memorial in Georgia over the course of 60 years:  

- Borglum Gutzon (1915-1924)
- Augustus Lukeman (1925-1928)
- Walter Hancock (1963-1972)
